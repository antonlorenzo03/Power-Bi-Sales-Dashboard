# Sales Dashboard (Power BI) & Analytics Report 
Beyond demonstrating technical proficiency in creating purposeful visualizations through a Power BI dashboard, I wanted to show how I would approach analyzing sample sales data through visualization techniques and turn them into actionable, data-driven insights.

## Project Components

## Dataset Description
This sample sales dataset from Kaggle contains global distribution data from a hypothetical retail company from January 2003 to May 2005. This company distributes to four main territories: EMEA, America, APAC, and Japan, with product lines focused on automotive and commercial/ mass transit vehicles.
