# Sales Dashboard (Power BI) & Analytics Report 
Beyond demonstrating technical proficiency in creating purposeful visualizations through a Power BI dashboard, I wanted to show how I would approach analyzing sample sales data through visualization techniques and turn them into actionable, data-driven insights.

## Dataset Description
This sample sales dataset from Kaggle contains global distribution data from a hypothetical retail company from January 2003 to May 2005. This company distributes to four main territories: EMEA, America, APAC, and Japan, with product lines focused on automotive and commercial/ mass transit vehicles. 

## What This Dashboard Solves
- Overview of YTD sales and orders
- Comparison of YTD sales with company KPI (hypothetical: 10% annual sales growth by EOY)
- Historical YoY growth rate
- Yearly and average monthly sales trends by territory
- Customer sales breakdown by year
- Order status and product line distribution breakdown by year

## Tools Used
- Power BI Desktop -- _for creating the interactive dashboard, filters, and slicers_
- Power BI Service -- _for publishing dashboard online_
- DAX -- _for calculated measures and conditional formatting for visualizations_
- Canva -- _for creating analytics report presentation_
