This Power BI dashboard project showcases key sales insights using sample data.  It highlights business performance through visualizations and performance metrics, and is accompanied by an analytics report that derives insights and offers actionable recommendations.

Beyond demonstrating technical proficiency in creating purposeful visualizations and dashboards through Power BI, I wanted to show how I would approach analyzing sample sales data through visualization techniques and turn them into actionable, data-driven insights.
